# Community-project-Lovelytech

A small community project combining an Express server and a React client.

This repository contains two main parts:

- `server/` — Node.js + Express API and backend logic.
- `client/` — React application bootstrapped with Create React App.

## Quick start

Prerequisites:

- Node.js (LTS recommended) and npm (or yarn).

From the repository root:

1. Install server dependencies and start the API:

	 - Open a terminal in `server/` and run:

		 npm install
		 npm start

2. Install and run the client:

	 - Open a terminal in `client/` and run:

		 npm install
		 npm start

The React app (client) runs on port 3000 by default. The server typically runs on port 5000 — check `server/index.js` or the `server` README for the exact port and environment variables.

## Repo layout

- `client/` — React frontend
- `server/` — Express backend (API routes, controllers, models)

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute:

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
2. Make your changes and add tests where appropriate.
3. Open a pull request describing the change and motivation.

## License

This project does not include a license file. Add one (for example `MIT`) if you plan to publish or accept contributions.
